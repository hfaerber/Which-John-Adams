          <h2>WELCOME <span class="p1-name">PLAYER 1 NAME</span> AND
            <span class="p2-name">PLAYER 2 NAME</span>!</h2>
          <p> The goal of the game is to find all 5 pairs of cards as quickly as
            possible. The player that finds the greatest numbers of pairs, wins.
          </p>
          <p> To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can click
            any card in the card pile. It will flip over and reveal a picture of
            Beyonce. Click another card. If they match, they will disappear and
            you will have completed a match! If they don't, you'll have three
            seconds to look at them before they flip back over. Then it's time
            for the other player to try!
          </p>
          <p>After you play, you'll see the name of the final winner and how
            long it took to win the game.</p>
